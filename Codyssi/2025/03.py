Puzzle Solution Script

This script solves a multi-part puzzle involving calculations and range
operations. Each part processes input data in different ways to produce
numerical answers.

Input format: Each line contains space-separated expressions (Part 1) or
range pairs (Parts 2-3). Range pairs are formatted as "start-end"
(e.g., "5-10").

    Args:
        expression (str): A string containing a mathematical expression

    Example:
        calc_total_number("5*3") returns 16 (|15| + 1)
